Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your Java integrated development environment (IDE).
Activate the main file to launch the application.
Login to the system using the provided credentials.
To access the admin interface, use the username "admin" and password "12345". To access the regular employee interface, use the username "mirit" and password "123".
